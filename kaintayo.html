                        Responsive Web App: Recipes
                    </h2>
                    <h2>The Process</h2>
                    <h3>Why Recipes</h3>
                    <p>
                        I chose this for a few reasons, firstly I do love to cook.
                        I really got into cooking when my daughter was born.
                        The crazy part is that my daughter had a lot of health issues
                        as she is allergic to 70% of all foods. So I was constantly
                        trying to finding ways to be able to feed her properly without
                        her having a reaction. Secondly, I found it frustrating to find
                        recipes that I would love to cook but she was allergic to them,
                        however with that I started finding ways to substitute ingredients
                        so that she could eat, but these were not in any of the
                        sites I ever went into.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        I thought I would work on a recipe app combining two things.
                        One, spotlighting fun healthy recipes that show alternatives
                        to ingredients on the recipes. Two, I thought I would focus
                        on
                        Filipino food recipes, I think underserved market.
