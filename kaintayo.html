                            <h3>Why Recipes</h3>
                            <p>
                                I chose this for a few reasons, firstly I do love to cook.
                                I really got into cooking when my daughter was born.
                                The crazy part is that my daughter had a lot of health issues
                                as she is allergic to 70% of all foods. So I was constantly
                                trying to find ways to be able to feed her properly without
                                her having a reaction. Secondly, I found it frustrating to find
                                recipes that I would love to cook but she was allergic to them,
                                however with that I started finding ways to substitute ingredients
                                so that she could eat, but these were not in any of the
                                sites I ever went into.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>
                                I thought I would work on a recipe app combining two things.
                                One, spotlighting fun healthy recipes that show alternatives
                                to ingredients on the recipes. Two, I thought I would focus
                                on
                                Filipino food recipes, I think underserved market.

                                These Users want to keep things simple and easy to follow recipes, this would be
                                accomplished by keeping the instructions in a simplified manner. Listing ingredient
                                alternatives, prep time,how long it will take to cook, how many servings,
                                nutrition info, and saving the recipe. An area where the User could add it onto
                                their shopping list. There would be an area where the User would see how good the

                                Here is a sample of my high fidelity wire frame, going from an iPhone to
                                a desktop version
                                responsive app.

                            <p>
                                In conclusion I really enjoyed this process from beginning to the final
                                design results of
                                this responsive web app. It was a large operation being able to do both
                                UX &amp UI.
                                There was so much to explore, so many challenges along the way, which
                                really assisted
                                on creating the best results for the app.
                                Thank you!
