                        I chose this for a few reasons, firstly I do love to cook. 
                        I really got into cooking when my daughter was born. 
                        The crazy part is that my daughter had a lot of health issues 
                        as she is allergic to 70% of all foods. So I was constantly 
                        trying to finding ways to be able to feed her properly without 
                        her having a reaction. Secondly, I found it frustrating to find 
                        recipes that I would love to cook but she was allergic to them, 
                        however with that I started finding ways to substitute ingredients 
                        so that she could eat, but these were not in any of the 
                        sites I ever went into.

                    I thought I would work on a recipe app combining two things. 
                    One, spotlighting fun healthy recipes that show alternatives 
                    to ingredients on the recipes. Two, I thought I would focus on 
                    Filipino food recipes, I think underserved market.
